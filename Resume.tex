\header{\textbf{Experience}}
    \employer{Crewcial Partners LLC \textsuperscript{\textcopyright}}
    {- New York, NY}{Jan 2023 -- May 2023}{Software Engineering Intern}
    \begin{bullet-list-minor}
	\item Developed a back-office application for the investment banking team with proprietary client portfolio details. Worked with AngularJS and HTML to create a dynamic page with live pricing changes. Streamlined ROI factors by including pathways in C\#. 
	\item Improved the firm's internal API by collaborating with the Data Engineering team and worked with the Equity Research team to design and implement strategic software applications to drive client portfolios.
    \end{bullet-list-minor}

    \employer{HJ Sims \& Co.}
    {- Fairfield, CT}{Sep 2022 -- Present}{Software Engineering Intern}
    \begin{bullet-list-minor}
        \item Assisted with the migration away from a third party commissioner service for this boutique brokerage firm to help drive down costs and improve proprietary trader net payouts. Wrote SQL scripts to query the data and used python to link the employees.
	\item Improved the UI of the AUM dashboard to include live changes after trades. Worked through a set of chargebacks that were resulting in wrong commission calculations for various employees which helped the firm process trade data at a higher rate.      
    \end{bullet-list-minor}
    
    \employer{Jalali Lab @ Rutgers ECE}
    {- Piscataway, NJ}{Jun 2022 -- Aug 2022}{Undergraduate Research Assistant}
    \begin{bullet-list-minor}
	\item Designed algorithms that combatted the effect of speckle noise in SAR imaging by using compression based sensing. Trained a convolution neural network using PyTorch with a data set including images of lungs with pneumonia.
	\item Reconstructed distorted images using the neural network's ability to re-identify and sharpen images by passing them through the trained model. Was able to achieve 90\% resolution of original, no-noise image from this method.  
    \end{bullet-list-minor}

    \employer{Bhattacharya Lab}
    {- New Brunswick, NJ}{Jan 2022 -- May 2022}{Undergraduate Research Associate}
    \begin{bullet-list-minor}
    \item Used Tensorflow Lite and Kotlin to design an android application that worked a one-stage detection model for coral reef. Included RGB testing on the backend using JScience to make conclusions about the health and survivability of the specimen. 
    \end{bullet-list-minor}

\header{\textbf{Projects}}
    \project{Techfer - \emph{Rutgers BITS Datathon Winner: Best Overall}}{-- SQL, Tableau, ChartJS, PyTorch -- \href{https://github.com/akhilvreddy/Rutgers-BITS-Datathon}{GitHub \faGithub\ }}{Nov 2022}
    \begin{bullet-list-minor}
    \item Studied a data set about a country's happiness index and drew statistical conclusions using regression tests, paired t-tests, and chi-square tests. Recognized and came to conclusions using numerical data as well as visual inputs.
    \item Utilized MySQL to sift \& clean the data set and Tableau to visualize partial tests compared to factors like GDP \& alcohol consumption using heat maps, 3D bar plots, and scatter plots.
    \item Implemented a convolution neural network to project happiness from base conditions and a random forest classification to predict the h-index. Performed linear regression to identify key relationships and trends in developing vs. developed countries happiness.
    
    \item Used a cross-correlation dataset about Carbon (CO2) emissions and ran inferential tests to understand how these emissions across the world have varying affects on happiness depending on country, time, and population characteristics.
    
    \end{bullet-list-minor}


    \project{Quantum Wavefunction Generator}{-- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Numba -- \href{https://github.com/akhilvreddy/Quantum-Wavefunction-Analysis}{GitHub \faGithub\ }}{May 2022}
	\begin{bullet-list-minor}
	\item Implemented Schrodinger's equation in Python for a single particle in varying potentials and calculated 5+ wavefunctions for corresponding particles using functions from SciPy \& Numpy. 
	\item Plotted resulting potentials and dynamic wavefunctions in  using Matplotlib and created a gif of evolutions over time. Achieved 60fps animation by overlapping two solutions, which was 30\% faster than using an online numeric solver.
